<h3>Abstract</h3>
Combined experimental and computational investigations of the CuNiFe spinodal system confirm that application of a mild magnetic field during thermal treatment alters elemental redistribution and the resulting microstructure, relative to that obtained from zero-field annealing. Spinodal decomposition of a Cu<sub>40</sub>Ni<sub>42</sub>Fe<sub>18</sub> alloy was initiated during thermal treatment at 773 K, conducted either under zero field or modest (60 mT) magnetic field conditions for up to 200 h. Periodic (~10 nm) chemical modulations into Cu-rich and NiFe-rich regions were observed under both conditions, with the amplitude and wavelength of the segregated regions increasing with treatment time. However, magnetic field annealing resulted in a more than twofold increase in the amplitude of elemental modulations relative to zero-field conditions – consistent with enhanced diffusional fluxes during spinodal decomposition – while the modulation wavelength remained largely unaffected. These microstructural differences are reflected in various extrinsic magnetic properties. In parallel, first-principles DFT calculations indicate that long-range ferromagnetic order, as induced by an applied magnetic field, substantially alters the strength and nature of atomic interactions, enhancing the thermodynamic instability of the CuNiFe solid solution. Collectively, these results suggest that incorporating a mild (millitesla-level) magnetic field – distinct from the strong (tesla-level) fields commonly used in prior studies – during thermal processing has the potential to deliver enhanced control of microstructures for targeted engineering outcomes.
