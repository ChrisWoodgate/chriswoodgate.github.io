<h3>Abstract</h3>
We describe an integrated modelling approach to accelerate the search for novel, single-phase, multicomponent materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA). For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA, magnetisation, and magnetic critical temperature (Curie temperature). Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same <i>ab initio</i> description of a material’s electronic structure determines all aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometries Fe4Ni3<i>X</i> and Fe3Ni4<i>X</i>, for additives including <i>X</i> = Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material’s MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal L10 order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material’s Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted hard magnetic properties.
