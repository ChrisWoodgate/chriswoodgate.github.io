<h3>Abstract</h3>
The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic Fe<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ni<sub><i>1-x</i></sub> alloys (0.4 <= x <= 0.6) is investigated within the framework of <i>ab initio</i> electronic structure calculations, using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered (A1) fcc phase, as well as the atomically ordered, tetragonal L1<sub>0</sub> phase - which is under consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free `gap' magnet for advanced engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure. Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys.
