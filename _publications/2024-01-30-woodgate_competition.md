<h3>Abstract</h3>
Refractory high-entropy alloys are under consideration for applications where materials are subjected to high temperatures and levels of radiation, such as in the fusion power sector. However, at present, their scope is limited because they are highly brittle at room temperature. One suggested route to mitigate this issue is by alloying with Ti. In this theoretical study, using a computationally efficient linear-response theory based on density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of the disordered alloys, we study the nature of atomic short-range order in these multi-component materials, as well as assessing their overall phase stability. Our analysis enables direct inference of phase transitions in addition to the extraction of an atomistic, pairwise model of the internal energy of an alloy suitable for study via, <i>e.g.</i> Monte Carlo simulations. Once Ti is added into either the NbMoTaW or VNbMoTaW system, we find that there is competition between chemical phase ordering and segregation. These results shed light on observed chemical inhomogeneity in experimental samples, as well as providing fundamental insight into the physics of these complex systems.
