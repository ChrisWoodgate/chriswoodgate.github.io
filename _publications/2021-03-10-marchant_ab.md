<h3>Abstract</h3>
A holistic approach for studying both the nature of atomic order and finite-temperature magnetostrictive behavior in the binary alloy Galfenol (Fe$_{1−x}$Ga$_x$ , $0 \leq x \leq 0.25$) is presented. The phase behavior is studied via atomistic modeling with inputs from ab initio calculations, and the ordered phases of interest at nonstoichiometric concentrations are verified to exhibit B2- and D0<sub>3</sub>-like order. The finite-temperature magnetoelasticity of these phases, in particular the magnetoelastic constant $B_1$, is obtained within the same <i>ab initio</i> framework using disordered local moment theory. Our results provide an explanation for the origin of the experimentally observed peak and subsequent fall in the material's magnetostriction at $x\sim0.19$, which has been disputed. In addition, we show that it is possible to enhance the magnetostriction of D0<sub>3</sub>−Fe<sub>3</sub>Ga by removing a small fraction of electrons from the system, suggesting that a Fe-Ga-Cu or Fe-Ga-Zn alloy could exhibit greater magnetostrictive properties than Galfenol.
