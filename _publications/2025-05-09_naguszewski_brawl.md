<h3>Abstract</h3>
We present BraWl, a Fortran package implementing a range of conventional and enhanced sampling algorithms for exploration of the phase space of the Bragg-Williams model, facilitating study of diffusional solid-solid transformations in binary and multicomponent alloys. These sampling algorithms include Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo, Wang-Landau sampling, and Nested Sampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by applying it to some prototypical binary and multicomponent alloys, including high-entropy alloys.
