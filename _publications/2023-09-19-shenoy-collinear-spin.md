<h3>Abstract</h3>
We have developed a new machine learned interatomic potential for the prototypical austenitic steel Fe$_7$Cr$_2$Ni, using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. This new GAP can model the alloy's properties with higher accuracy than classical interatomic potentials like embedded atom models (EAM), while also allowing us to collect much more statistics than expensive first-principles methods like density functional theory (DFT). We also extended the GAP input descriptors to approximate the effects of collinear spins (Spin GAP), and demonstrate how this extended model successfully predicts low temperature structural distortions due to the antiferromagnetic spin state. We demonstrate the application of the Spin GAP model for bulk properties and vacancies and validate against DFT. These results are a step towards modelling ageing in austenitic steels with close to DFT accuracy but at a fraction of its cost.
