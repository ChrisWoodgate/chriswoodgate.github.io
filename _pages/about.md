I am a theoretical physicist and computational materials scientist, currently an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow and <a href="https://www.sc.stfc.ac.uk/programmes/cosec/" target="_blank">CoSeC</a> Fellow in the School of Physics at the University of Bristol, UK. Here is a link to my <a href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/christopher-d-woodgate" target="_blank">Bristol profile</a>. Prior to joining Bristol I was a PhD student and then a Research Fellow in the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick. I maintain a visiting affiliation to Warwick through my position as an Honorary Research Fellow. Here is a link to my <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/people/studentscohort1/woodgate/" target="_blank">old Warwick homepage</a>.

Most broadly, my research is focussed on leveraging quantum mechanical calculations (most frequently density functional theory, DFT) to describe how electrons arrange themselves in materials. This can provide fundamental insight into a range of physical phenomena, as well as lead to predictive modelling of a variety of physical properties of materials for applications. Additionally, I am interested in using information gleaned from such quantum mechanical calculations to build 'atomistic' models of materials, where the electrons are ignored and atoms are treated as a set of point-like objects interacting with each other via some form of 'potential'. Finally, I am interested in the development of new methods for simulation of materials, and in writing software implementing these methods.

Current activities focuses on the physics of alloys and magnetic systems, including high-entropy alloys and rare-earth-free permanent magnets. In these systems, I use computational modelling to help us better understand the physics of existing materials, to suggest routes by which their properties might be optimised for applications, and to propose new materials compositions with potentially desirable performance attributes.
