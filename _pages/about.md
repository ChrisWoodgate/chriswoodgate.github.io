I am a computational materials scientist, currently a Research Fellow in the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick. Here is a link to my <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/people/studentscohort1/woodgate/" target="_blank">old Warwick homepage</a>.

Most broadly, I am interested in the physics of materials for energy applications. My current research focuses on the physics of alloys and magnetic systems. In particular, I am interested in how atomic arrangments in alloys can affect their physical properties. For more information about my research and teaching, please see the other pages on this site.
