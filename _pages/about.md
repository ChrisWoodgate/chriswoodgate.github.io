I am a computational materials scientist, currently based in the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick.

Most broadly, I am interested in the physics of materials for energy applications. My current research focuses on the physics of alloys and magnetic systems. In particular, I am interested in how atomic arrangments in alloys can affect their magnetic properties. For more information about my research and teaching, please follow the links above.
