Outside of academia, I have two main hobbies, the sport of archery and the ringing of church bells.

<h3>Archery</h3>
I am heavily involved in the sport of archery, competiting at a county level. As a student I represented the University of Warwick on numerous occasions, winning a number of BUCS Championship medals. I am also a qualified Archery GB Level 2 coach.

<h3>Bell Ringing</h3>
I enjoy the (rather old-fashioned) English tradition of bell ringing, otherwise known as campanology. I am Steeple Keeper at All Saints Church, Leamington Spa, which houses a 12cwt ring of eight bells.
