Outside of academia, I have two main hobbies, the sport of archery and the ringing of church bells.

<h3>Archery</h3>
I am heavily involved in the sport of archery, competing at a county level. As a student I represented the University of Warwick on numerous occasions, winning a handful of BUCS Championship medals. At the University of Warwick club, I also held a number of voluntary committee positions, including as Team Captain (2016/17), Equipment Officer (2019/20, 2020/21), and Club Secretary (2021/22). I am also a qualified [Archery GB](https://archerygb.org/) Level 2 coach.

<h3>Bell Ringing</h3>
I enjoy the (rather old-fashioned) English tradition of [change-ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing). I am currently Steeple Keeper and Deputy Tower Captain at [All Saints Church, Leamington Spa](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/tower/15929), which houses a 13 cwt ring of eight bells. I am a full member of the [Association of Ringing Teachers (ART)](https://bellringing.org). A few performances can be found [on BellBoard](https://bellboard.uk/search.php?ringer=Christopher+Woodgate).
