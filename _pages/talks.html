<p>
I have experience of presenting both contributed and invited talks at a range of seminars and conferences, both in the UK and internationally. In the past, I have also given a number of poster presentations. You can <a href="/talkmap.html" style="color:#52adc8;">click here</a> to see a map of all the places I've presented!
