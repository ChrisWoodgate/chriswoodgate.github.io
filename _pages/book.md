I have authored a book outlining the approach we have developed for modelling atomic arrangements in multicomponent alloys, which is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the disordered alloy as described within the Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker (KKR) formulation of density functional theory (DFT), using the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to average over disorder. It represents an an enlarged and extensively reworked version of my doctoral thesis, including new results and additional commentary.

The book was published by Springer Nature in 2024 as volume 346 of the [Springer Series in Materials Science](https://www.springer.com/series/0856). More details can be found via [this link](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62021-8), and the book cover is shown below.
