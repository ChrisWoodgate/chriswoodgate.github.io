I have authored a book outlining the approach I have developed for modelling atomic arrangements in multicomponent alloys. This is due to be published by Springer Nature in late-2024 as part of the [Springer Series in Materials Science](https://www.springer.com/series/0856). More details can be found via [this link](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031620201), and a draft cover is shown below.
