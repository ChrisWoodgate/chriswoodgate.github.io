If you are interested in engaging with me for some form of outreach activity or conference organisation, please [email me](mailto:christopher.woodgate@physics.org)!

Outreach & Public Engagement
------
* [Multiscale Musings](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/outreach/multiscalemusings/) -- Podcast.
  * Lead host for the first series of this popular science podcast. 
  * We interviewed academics with research interests in the area of predictive modelling, talking to them about their hobbies and interests, and also details of their research. 
  * The podcast is aimed at a general scientific audience.
* [The Computational Toolkit](https://computationaltoolkit.github.io) -- Seminar Series.
  * Contributed to the organisation of this seminar series aimed at those starting a career in computational science. 
  * Gave a webinar titled "An Introduction to High-Performance Computing".
* Sessions for Work Experience Students.
  * I have previously been involved with engaging with work experience students on placement in the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick. In 2024, with support from Prof. David Quigley, I led a session titled 'From Electrons to the Bulk Modulus', introducing the concept that, by using high-performance computing and electronic structure calculations, we can model real materials 'from first principles'.
* Outreach in Schools.
  * I have previously delivered talks in schools talking about my research, the transition from school/sixth-form/college to higher-education, and careers in science more generally.

Seminar/Conference Organisation
------
* January 2025. Session Chair, 16th Joint MMM/Intermag, New Orleans, USA.
* July 2024. Poster judge at the International Conference on Magnetism (ICM 2024, Bologna).
* October 2023 - July 2024. Joint organiser for the Warwick Physics Theory seminar.
* July 2023. Chair for two sessions at the HetSys CDT annual conference.
