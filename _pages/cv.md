Experience
------
* October 2023 - Present: Research Fellow, University of Warwick
  * Based in the group of Prof. Julie B. Staunton.
  * Employed on a joint UK-US research project funded by the EPSRC (UK) and the NSF and DOE (US). The project is focussed on the design, synthesis, and manufacture of novel rare-earth-lean and rare-earth-free permanent magnets.
  * I use DFT calculations, a linear-response theory, and atomistic modelling to understand the phase behaviour of these complex, magnetic alloy systems. There is close collaboration with theoretical colleagues at the University of Oxford (UK) and with experimental colleagues at Northeastern University and the University of Delaware (US).
* October 2019 - September 2023: PhD Student, University of Warwick
  * Supervisor: Prof. Julie B. Staunton (University of Warwick).
  * Project Title: <i>"Physics of magnets and the arrangements of atoms comprising them</i>
  * In this project, a first principles computational modelling technique for studying atomic arrangements in multicomponent alloys has been developed. Integrated within the same framework, we are able to go on to examine the effects of these atomic arrangements on a material’s magnetic properties. The approach is being used to study next-generation, novel materials for a range of applications. Systems studied include Galfenol (an Fe-Ga alloy used in sensor and actuator applications), and two families of high-entropy alloys which are of interest for engineering applications including in fusion reactors. The project has now moved on to study the Fe-Ni system and potential additives, working with the experimental group of Prof. Laura H. Lewis at Northeastern University (Boston, USA) with the aim of searching for candidate materials to be used as rare-earth-free permanent magnets.
* October 2018 - July 2019: Final-Year Project Student, University of Warwick
  * Supervisor: Dr Nicholas d'Ambrumenil (University of Warwick)
  * Project title: <i>“Antiferromagnetic Modulations in Dipolar Ferromagnets”</i>
  * This project studied the high-field, low temperature, ferromagnetic phase of Gadolinium Gallium Garnet, a geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet. A number of aspects of the system were studied, and a measure of the modulation of the ferromagnetic state as a function of external field was delivered. The work was a combination of analytics and numerics, initially in Mathematica but also later in C for efficiency.
* Summer 2017: URSS Student, University of Warwick
  * Supervisor: Dr Michal Kreps (University of Warwick, CERN).
  * Project Title: <i>"Feasibility of Measurement of $\Xi_b$ Polarisation at the LHCb Experiment"</i>.
  * This project was part of a feasibility study for the measurement of the “production polarisation” of a particular particle decay chain. The angular distribution for the particle decay chain was derived - working largely in Mathematica. Some existing C++ code was adapted to run simulations and determine the accuracy with which physical parameters could be measured.
