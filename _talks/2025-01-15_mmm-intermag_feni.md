<h2>Abstract</h2>
The ever-growing demand for advanced permanent magnets is accompanied by a pressing need for materials of reduced critical element content, including rare earth elements, which carry concerns around price volatility, geopolitical sensitivities, and significant environmental impact. One rare-earth-free magnetic material of current interest is atomically ordered FeNi [1], which crystallizes in the L1<sub>0</sub> structure and is commonly referred to by its meteoritic mineral name, tetrataenite [2]. However, a low atomic ordering temperature and consequently sluggish kinetics make this material challenging to synthesize in industrially relevant timeframes. Here, new results dervied from first-principles computational approaches will be presented examining the combined impacts of mechanical strain, applied magnetic field, and varying Fe:Ni ratio on the L1<sub>0</sub> ordering temperature of this material (Fig. 1). These results are in alignment with recent experimental outcomes reporting induced atomic order in bulk specimens, given suitable processing conditions [3]. Our DFT-based methodology [4,5] enables holistic modelling of both atomic ordering and associated magnetocrystalline anisotropy—including the effects of finite temperature —within the same computational framework. These results suggest new routes by which bulk synthesis of this material could potentially be achieved.
