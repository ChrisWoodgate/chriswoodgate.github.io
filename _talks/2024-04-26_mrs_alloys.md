<h2>Abstract</h2>
In the rapidly developing field of high-entropy materials, computational forward modelling approaches are an important tool to help guide experiment towards appropriate compositions. Starting from a given combination of constituent elements, we would like to be able to predict both the crystal structure and propensity to form either an disordered solid-solution or an intermetallic phase, as this will enable us to go on to predict subsequent macroscopic materials properties. We present results from a first-principles-based, all-electron Landau theory which has previously been used with success to study the Cantor alloy and its derivatives [1,2], as well as the refractory high-entropy alloys [3]. We study the Al<sub>x</sub>CrFeCoNi system for x between 0 and 2, and demonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces the experimentally observed crystal structure and phase behavour of this material. We successfully predict the A1+B2 coexistence region of the phase diagram, explain the lack of observation of an atomically disordered A2 phase, and give insight into the preferred low-temperature atomic arrangements. As the methodology is first-principled, we are able to explain ordering tendencies in terms of materials' underlying electronic structure, and pull out qualitative rules to explain ordering tendencies in these complex systems.
